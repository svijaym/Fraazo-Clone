# Frazzo Clone



Hello, I am going to talk about the Fraazo.com clone, a website that we built up for our unit-3 construct week project task at Masai school. Website development is fun when all the team members collaborate and make a good website. Let me introduce you to my team-mates/collaborators :

S. Vijayprasad,
Shashank Kumar,
Alok Kumar Das.

Original website link : https://fraazo.com/

As we are still in the learning phase, the journey of building this website was very nice. We realized we couldâ€™ve achieved even more precision in building the website, but time was running out.

We still managed to pull this job to satisfactory results. Everyone was happy about it, it was like working hard on the farm, and then reaping the benefits of the tasty grains. The feeling of completing the project was very satisfying. Hard work pays off.

Hope you liked reading this blog post till this end.

Thank you for taking the time to read this blog.
